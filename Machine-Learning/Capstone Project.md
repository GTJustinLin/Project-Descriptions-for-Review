# Project 5: Capstone Project
## Capstone Project Overview
In this capstone project, you will leverage what youâ€™ve learned throughout the Nanodegree program to solve a problem of your choice by applying machine learning algorithms and techniques. You will first **define** the problem you want to solve and investigate potential solutions and performance metrics. Next, you will **analyze** the problem through visualizations and data exploration to have a better understanding of what algorithms and features are appropriate for solving it. You will then **implement** your algorithms and metrics of choice, documenting the preprocessing, refinement, and postprocessing steps along the way. Afterwards, you will collect **results** about the performance of the models used, visualize significant quantities, and validate/justify these values. Finally, you will construct **conclusions** about your results, and discuss whether your implementation adequately solves the problem.

## Capstone Project Highlights
This project is designed to prepare you for delivering a polished, end-to-end solution report of a real-world problem in a field of interest. When developing new technology, or deriving adaptations of previous technology, properly documenting your process is critical for both validating and replicating your results.  

Things you will learn by completing this project:

- How to research and investigate a real-world problem of interest.
- How to accurately apply specific machine learning algorithms and techniques.
- How to properly analyze and visualize your data and results for validity.
- How to document and write a report of your work.

## Capstone Project Description
Think about a problem domain that you are passionate about, such as healthcare, engineering, finance, robotics, marketing, bio-informatics, or something that excites you. Then, choose an existing problem within that domain which you could solve by applying machine learning algorithms and techniques. Be sure that you have collected all of the resources needed (such as data sets) to complete this project, and make the appropriate citations wherever necessary in your report.

For whichever application area or problem you ultimately investigate, there are five major phases to this capstone project which you will document. Each phase plays a significant role in the development life cycle of beginning with a problem definition and finishing with a polished, working solution. As you make your way through developing your project, keep a mental checklist of these phases with the following questions provided, to ensure that each have been thoroughly documented and satisfy the requirements of the [capstone project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/108/view).  

You can find a [project report template here](https://github.com/udacity/machine-learning/blob/master/projects/capstone/project_report_template.md), which can serve as a guideline for writing your report. **Your submitted report should follow this general structure to streamline the evaluation process.**

## Software and Libraries
**Your project must be written in Python 2.7.** Given the free-form nature of this capstone project, the software and libraries you will need to successfully complete your work will vary depending on the chosen application area and problem definition. Because of this, it is imperative all necessary software and libraries used in your capstone project are accessible to the reviewer. An included README file which documents the software used, Python libraries (including version), and extraneous installation information is sufficient.

## Deliverables
The following files should be included in your submission, and can be packaged as a single zip file for convenience:
- A 9 - 15 page report in PDF addressing the five major project development phases.
- All development code necessary for your solution in a clean, commented format.
- Any required supporting files for your code (.csv datasets, input files, etc.). 
   - *If you find that these files are too large, please instead reference appropriate download links in the README.*
- A README documenting the software and libraries used in your project, including any necessary instructions required to execute your code.

### Evaluation
Your project will be reviewed by a Udacity reviewer against **<a href="https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/108/view">this rubric</a>**. Be sure to review it thoroughly before you submit. All criteria must "meet specifications" in order to pass.

### Submission
When you're ready to submit your project go back to your <a href="https://www.udacity.com/me" target="_blank">Udacity Home</a>, click on Project 5, and we'll walk you through the rest of the submission process.

If you are having any problems submitting your project or wish to check on the status of your submission, please email us at **machine-support@udacity.com** or visit us in the <a href="http://discussions.udacity.com" target="_blank">discussion forums</a>.

### What's Next?
You will get an email as soon as your reviewer has feedback for you. In the meantime, review your next project and feel free to get started on it or the courses supporting it!

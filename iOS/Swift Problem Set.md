##Project Overview
Students will complete a series of coding exercises to test their understanding of Swift. The problem set contains a section of problems on variables, strings, if (else if and else) statements, and functions.

##Why this project?
This project helps students solidify their understanding of basic Swift concepts through practice. Being able to complete the problem set demonstrates that a student has the prerequisite knowledge required to move forward and create their first app later in the curriculum.

##What will you learn?
* Declare variables and constants with basic Swift types
* Create, combine, and manipulate Swift strings
* Exercise basic control flow using if, else-if, and else statements
* Abstract reusable code into functions with zero to many parameters

##Why is this project meaningful to my career?
The first step towards building iOS applications is learning the (Swift) language and syntax. By completing this project, one demonstrates that they know the language well enough to begin learning Apple's frameworks for creating native iOS applications.

##How do I complete this project?
1. Review the grading rubric to see how your project will be assessed. All criteria must "meet specifications" in order to pass.
2. If necessary, review the supporting **Swift for Beginners** course to refresh your understanding of concepts.
3. Download the Swift Problem Set and complete each exercise.

##Evaluation
Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity Code Reviewer according to a grading rubric. All criteria must "meet specifications" in order to pass.

##Submission

Before submitting your answers for evaluation, we recommend that you check that each of the following is true:

* Your problem set contains no warnings or errors
* You are proud of your answers
* You completed each problem in the set according to the instructions
* You reviewed the grading rubric

### Project Overview

You work for a retail store chain in the United States of America. The company is thinking of expanding to other countries and want to figure out which countries are similar economically, demographically, education, and environment to the United States of America. You are tasked with finding out which countries fit this criteria.

### Project Details
You work for a retail store chain that only has a presence of stores in the United States. The company is thinking of expanding to other countries, but would like to start this process with countries that are similar economically and demographically to the United States. 

Your manager has asked you to segment the countries of the world based on various economic, demographic, education, and environment data. From this you should be able to provide a list of countries that are similar to the United States. This will be the “short list” for further consideration by management.

You have the following information to work with:

A set of various data taken from the [World Bank web site](http://databank.worldbank.org/data/databases.aspx?qterm=&pagenumber=1)

### Steps to Success

#### Step 1. Key Decisions
Determine the key business questions and specific types of data you need to look at in order to complete this analysis.

#### Step 2. Explore and Cleanup the Data
Clean up the data in the provided CSV file. The data contains 215 countries with 77 variables. 

Not all of the countries have complete data and not all of the variables may be applicable for the analysis. Based on the request from your manager, you will need to determine how to handle the countries with incomplete data. You should also decide which variables are not appropriate for including in the analysis (i.e., which variables may not be relevant). 

#### Step 3. Determine Clusters and Methodology
Your manager would like to see four clusters in the results. You also need to determine which clustering method provides the optimal clusters.

#### Step 4. Run the Data and Validate

After you run the model with the data you’ve decided to use, append the Cluster IDs back to the data in order to visualize the data.

Feel free to use any visualization software you want such as Tableau.

#### Step 5. Recommendation
Provide your recommendations and justify why your countries should considered to be explored first for international expansion.

### Project Overview

In this project, you'll use Tableau to build dashboards and tell a story with data. This is an essential skill as an analyst. You'll be exploring data from *Lending Club*, a peer to peer lending platform. 

You'll start by defining some leading questions, then you'll explore the data to find answers, and finally build visualizations to communicate those answers and tell a story.

### Installing Tableau

## Project Details

You're an analyst at Lending Club assigned to analyze loan data. Your manager has requested you to investigate the data to answer three main questions:

* How do the attributes differ between borrowers who pay back their loans versus those who don't?
* How do accepted and rejected loan data differ among different locations?
* How have issued loans changed over time?

On top of that, your manager has requested that you pick another question of your own to explore and report on.

## Submission

* For each question, your submission should include a Tableau dashboard with a set of visualizations that help answers the question. Make sure to include the question you are answering.

* For one of the questions, create a narrative told through the visualizations and text.

### Submission Requirements

You should include at least one of each of these figures (among all the dashboards, not in each out):
  * Map plot (if location data is available)
  * Line plot (if time/date data is available)
  * Shape (scatter) plot
  * Bar chart
  * Small multiple

Also, include the following uses of color/shape/size:
  * Group by color/shape
  * Indicate a third continuous dimension with color and/or size
  * Highlight data of interest with color
  * Choose appropriate color palettes (diverging, sequential, colorblind friendly)

Demonstrate an effective use of labels:
  * Clear labels on all axes and legends
  * Label data of interest (Optional)

Include interactivity in dashboards and stories:
  * Filters
  * Highlighting or other actions

### Submission Format
Your submission should be in the form of a PDF file accompanied with Tableau workbook files

### Review

Use the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/329/view) to review your project. If you are happy with your submission, then you're ready to submit your project. If you see room for improvement, keep working to improve your project.

## Data

The Lending Club data includes three files found at the bottom of the page:  

*[LoanStats3a](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/September/57e9e5c8_loanstats3a/loanstats3a.csv)* - This shows the data for loans accepted by Lending Club.

*[RejectStatsA](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/September/57e9e5d9_rejectstatsa/rejectstatsa.csv)* - This shows the data for loans rejected by Lending Club.

*[LCData Dictionary](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/September/57e9e5be_lcdatadictionary/lcdatadictionary.xlsx)* - This explains what each of the variables in the both datasets represents. Use this to understand the variables as you explore the data to find answers to the questions.
